"""
This module provides a client implementation for interacting with MCP (Model Control Protocol) servers.

It includes the MCPClient class, which offers methods to connect to MCP servers using either
stdio or SSE transport, list available tools, and execute tools on the server.

This version of client.py enhances the original by adding several features,
primarily tailored for distributed reinforcement learning training and
improved support for SSE transport:
1. Improved error handling:
   - `is_safe_cleanup_error()`: Identifies ignorable cleanup errors.
   - `is_connection_error_type()`: Identifies connection error types.
   - More fine-grained error categorization and handling.

2. Safe management of SSE connections:
   - `safe_sse_client()`: A safe wrapper for the SSE client that ensures proper cleanup.
   - Controls the `httpx.AsyncClient` lifecycle to avoid common errors during cleanup.

3. Enhanced retry mechanisms:
   - `connect_to_stdio_server()` and `connect_to_sse_server()` support retries.
   - Implements an exponential backoff strategy.
   - Checks server availability before attempting connection.

4. Timeout control:
   - `call_timeout` parameter: Controls timeout for a single tool call.
   - `execute_tool()` leverages `asyncio.wait_for()` to enforce timeout.

5. Connection configuration management:
   - `_connection_config` attribute: Stores connection configuration for reconnects.
   - Optional connection health checks.

6. Logging and debugging improvements:
   - More detailed and informative logging.
   - Suppresses noisy logs from the MCP SDK.
   - Clearer diagnostic messages for errors.

7. Optimizations for Ray/async environments:
   - Handles cancel scope errors gracefully.
   - Manages cross-task cleanup error handling.

    Wrapper for sse_client that ensures proper cleanup of SSE connections.

    Key design: creates and controls the httpx.AsyncClient lifecycle separately
    from the MCP SDK's sse_client generator. During cleanup:

    1. Force-close the httpx client FIRST → breaks the SSE HTTP stream
    2. The background sse_reader task gets a connection error and stops immediately
    3. The anyio TaskGroup inside sse_client can now exit cleanly
    4. Then close the sse_client generator (quick, since all I/O is dead)

    This prevents the common cleanup errors:
    - "generator didn't stop after athrow()" (from aconnect_sse trying to drain an infinite SSE stream)
    - "Attempted to exit cancel scope in a different task" (from dangling TaskGroup during GC)
    - "aclose(): asynchronous generator is already running" (from GC finalizer conflicts)
